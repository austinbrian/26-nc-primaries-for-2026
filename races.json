      "fullText": "The state Senate showdown between GOP leader Phil Berger and Rockingham County Sheriff Sam Page is undoubtedly the most important North Carolina primary to watch.\n\nBerger joined the chamber in 2001 and took over a decade later thanks in large part to a GOP wave fueled by public frustration over the slow recovery from the Great Recession under Democratic leadership.\n\nWith Berger at the helm, the legislature has targeted illegal immigration, lowered corporate and personal income tax rates, expanded Medicaid, and entrenched the GOP's political grip in the state by drawing highly favorable voting maps, reconfiguring the makeup of various agencies, and making statewide judicial contests partisan.\n\nBut Berger drew the ire of constituents and fellow Republican leaders in 2023 after pushing for a casino in Rockingham County. He ultimately lost a showdown with then-House Speaker Tim Moore, whose chamber opposed including non-tribal casinos and video lottery terminals in the state budget.\n\nAs Page spotted cracks in Berger's armor, he weighed whether to run against him in 2024. The Rockingham County sheriff met privately with Berger in December 2023 before sticking with his original plan to run for lieutenant governor.\n\nPage finished fifth in the 11-candidate primary, but he won more votes in his home county than all of his opponents combined. In the same election, Berger's son Kevin survived a primary challenge to hang onto his county commission seat by a mere three votes, or 0.01 percentage points.\n\nPage announced last year that he would take on the senior Berger. His bid comes in spite of an arm-twisting effort by his party to convince him not to run. A top state senator left a note at Page's doorstep pleading for him to drop out, WRAL reported, and President Donald Trump urged Page to drop out of the race and offered him a role in his administration.\n\nA primary victory for Berger would reaffirm his influence, while a defeat could signal growing frustration with the status quo in Raleigh.\n\nWhat little reliable polling we've seen in this race suggests it could be close.\n\nBut for all the attention Rockingham County has received, the outcome will likely be decided in Guilford County, which constitutes 57% of the district. This could benefit Berger, who is both better known and has more resources to reach voters in the Greensboro media market.\n\nPage entered 2026 with over $29,000 in his campaign coffers, which pales in comparison to the nearly $1.6 million Berger had in cash on hand, according to the candidates' latest finance reports."

Don Davis' seat from a tossup to leaning Republican, according to the nonpartisan Cook Political Report.\n\nArmy veteran Laurie Buckhout is seen as the favorite to win the GOP primary, given her name recognition from a narrow loss to Davis in 2024 and a sizable financial advantage over her primary competitors.\n\nState Sen. Bobby Hanig of Currituck County, businessman Eric Rouse, Carteret County Sheriff Asa Buck, and divorce attorney Ashley-Nicole Russell are also vying for the nomination.\n\nBuckhout wasn't planning to run, but changed her mind and got into the race after Rocky Mount Mayor Sandy Roberson dropped out. Buckhout had previously voiced health concerns over burn pit exposure she experienced in Iraq, but she says her health improved after she took a cyber defense job in the Trump administration in March 2025.\n\nHanig is arguably the next-most prominent candidate after he publicly lobbied his state House counterparts to tank a bill banning shrimp trawling.\n\nRouse presents himself as the most Trump-aligned candidate in the race, noting Hanig initially endorsed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in 2024.\n\nBuck was first elected sheriff in 2006 and is well known in his own community, but the district includes parts of 25 counties. And between her more limited campaign resources and lack of elected experience, Russell has the biggest uphill battle.\n\nLatest campaign finance reports show Buckhout entered 2026 with nearly twice as much money as her four opponents combined. Nearly all of it came from a personal loan she made to her campaign."

The outcome will show the direction one of the state's most liberal districts is heading. (Democrat Mary Patterson is also running, but isn't seen as a serious threat.)\n\nIn 2022, Allam lost to Foushee by 9 percentage points. But that was in an eight-person field, and the district has been altered dramatically since then, likely to Allam's advantage.\n\nThe 4th District included all or parts of six counties in 2022; Allam carried Durham, while Foushee handily won the rest. This year, four of the five counties Foushee won have been drawn out: Alamance, Caswell, Granville, and Person. Orange County remains, but it has less than half as many voters as Durham. The district also gained one-fifth of Wake and most of Chatham.\n\nAllam is off to a strong start since announcing her campaign in December. The Durham County commissioner raised more than $334,000 in roughly three weeks, while Foushee took in less than $140,000 over the quarter.\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Allam are scheduled to host an event on Friday as part of the senator's \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour, and Sanders has called Allam \"a great progressive candidate for Congress.\"\n\nFoushee has support from the state Democratic Party's congressional delegation, Gov. Josh Stein and former Gov. Roy Cooper, and top state legislative Democrats.\n\nImmigration and U.S. support for Israel are likely to be the most pressing issues in the race. Last year, Allam posted a video of federal agents taking three individuals into custody outside a shopping center. She accused the agents of \"kidnapping people\" and directed her supporters to call an advocacy group if they spot officers. Foushee has called for federal immigration enforcement agents to be unmasked and for Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to resign.\n\nThe two candidates have also tangled over the role the U.S. should have in the war in Gaza.\n\nAllam, the first Muslim woman to hold elected office in North Carolina, apologized in 2022 for a tweet that she said was unintentionally anti-Semitic. She has criticized Foushee for accepting more than $2 million during the 2022 election from United Democracy Project, the political arm of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, and for traveling to Israel with a delegation the group organized. Foushee said at a town hall last year that she wouldn't accept money from the group in the 2026 election.\n\nFoushee said last month that she opposes additional spending on conflicts in the Middle East and South America beyond humanitarian relief."

      "fullText": "Since joining the House in 2019, Rep. Jake Johnson of Polk County has steadily risen through party ranks to deputy majority whip, working to keep the caucus together on key votes.\n\nWhen Hurricane Helene struck his district, he was quick to call for additional relief. But Western North Carolina continues to grapple with a slow recovery, which Republicans and Democrats alike have pinned on the federal bureaucracy.\n\nWhile state lawmakers have passed multiple rounds of relief funding, homeowners and small businesses continue to struggle. This race could tell us how much voters blame Republican leaders.\n\nJohnson faces a challenge from former House Majority Leader Mike Hager, who abruptly resigned in 2016. A former engineer for Duke Energy, Hager occasionally clashed with top Republicans in the chamber and launched an unsuccessful bid for House speaker in 2014.\n\nThe primary shows signs of becoming one of the most expensive in the state. Hager entered 2026 with nearly $158,000 in available cash to Johnson's $119,000."

But in a move unlikely to win her brownie points with her base, she questioned the president's endorsement of Whatley: \"President Trump does not truly know the landscape of NC politics.\"\n\nMany of the anti-establishment voters who helped Morrow last election are siding with Don Brown, a former Navy JAG officer, as the best alternative to Whatley. Several conservative activists, including her 2024 campaign manager, have lobbed personal attacks.\n\nCould Morrow prove the entire political world wrong once again? We'll find out soon."
